Tilton, NH - Robert Banks Hamor, age 71, died the evening of Sunday, September 2, 2018 after an ongoing struggle with terminal service-connected illnesses related to his in-country duty in Vietnam. Robert passed peacefully surrounded by close family.

Mr. Hamor is survived by his son Sean Sosik-Hamor, his mother Barbara Hamor, his ex-wife Joyce Hamor, and his brother Richard Hamor.

Born in Biddeford, Maine on July 8, 1947, Robert enjoyed spending time on Little Ossipee Lake in Waterboro, Maine. After his time in Vietnam he owned a Southern New Hampshire photography business and acted as president of the New Hampshire Professional Photographers Association. Once retired, photography followed him as his primary hobby. Touring the Eastern United States and Canada working on personal photography projects from his motorhome was his passion.

Per Robert's wishes, he will be cremated and there will be no funeral service. Instead, a small celebration of life will be planned in the weeks following for close friends and family. Announcement to be made on bobhamor.com.

In lieu of flowers or gifts please consider making a donation in Robert's name to the New Hampshire Veterans Home Resident Benefit Fund. The NHVH is where Robert was taken care of and we can't speak highly enough of their wonderful services.
